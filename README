Dependencies

Latrunculi was written in Scheme using the Chicken Scheme (http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/) implementation
and utilizes the following libraries in addition:
-NCURSES
-OpenGL
-SRFI-1 (List library)
-SRFI-4 (homogenous vector library)
-Lolevel (pointers, etc. Required for OpenGL)
-SRFI-43 (Vector library)
-SRFI-13 (String library)

To build under Chicken Scheme, make sure that you first have installed all of the above modules, then run:
csc main.scm -o latrunculi

This should produce a working binary.
