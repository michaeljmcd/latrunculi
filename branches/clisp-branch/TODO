Port TODO:
-First, finish porting main, move, and ai. 
-Move each of these into a LISP package.
-gfx is a mess; revamp/rewrite it. Most likely, targa will go away by using SDL with OpenGL and allowing
 SDL to handle windowing, controls, and text
-savegame will, most likely, be rewritten. This "module" was experimental anyway, but the idea will remain:
 simply write out the read syntax for the game's data structures
-rewrite readme
-rewrite makefile
-refactor some functions (in AI especially) to avoid let*

The porting here is a lot of work, but it is, in my estimation, necessary as Chicken does not support the
requisite bindings and Ocean is too far away to be useful. The requisite bindings seem to be there and
the work should progress quickly. Moreover, the code revamp is good as a lot of these areas were pretty
hacked up anyway (see: gfx).

Main TODO:
-Try to make the delta of the progress during a slide a function of the overall length of the move.
-Implement random move selection.
-Playtesting AI to tune constants.
-Add text showing player's names to the screen.
-Add text showing whether the AI is thinking.
-Add turn indicator.
