<b><b><font face="Arial">
</font></b></b><ol><b><b><font face="Arial">Latrunculi was the most
popular thinking man's game in the Roman Empire. The name comes from
the word latrones which originally meant 'mercenaries' and which
referred to 'soldiers' in early Roman times, according to Varro.
However, in later Roman times the term came to be used for highwaymen,
or 'robber-soldiers' as they were known. Numerous boards have been
found and they vary in size, but the most common size is 12 by 8.
Archeological finds in Italy and Britain suggest that Latrunculi had
two playing pieces, distinguishing this game from the earlier single
stone version the Greeks called Petteia (aka City or Polis). Latrunculi
most certainly derives from the Greek game <i>Petteia</i>, which means
"pebbles" or "stones". Plato tells us that Petteia originally came from
Egypt. If so, he was probably referring to the Egyptian precursor game
called Siga (or Seega).</font></b></b><p>

<b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial">
Boards varied in size; some boards were 8 x 8, 8 x 7, or 9 x 10. It may
be impossible to determine which of these boards were for what game,
but the size of the board may not have affected the style of play.
Boards for all these games, therefore, may have been interchangeable.
Boards were made of wood, but some were made of stone, marble, or even
silver. <img src="latruncu_files/petteia.jpg" align="left" height="176" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="200">The
image at left shows a fragment of what may be a Petteia board and
stones found at Athens. Latrunculi is first mentioned by Varro (116-27
B.C.) but is probably much older, and is last mentioned by Macrobius
around 400 A. D., when he rebukes those that "played at Tabula and
Latrunculi." Ovid tells us that the pieces were of different colored
glass, sometimes precious stones. He also states that a piece is taken
by custodial capture (sandwiched between two other pieces) and that
"backward moves" were allowed. </font></b></font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial">Latrunculi is played
with two types of pieces, the stones and an extra piece called a King
(per Hnefatafl) or a Dux (Duke) per some sources (previously called an
Eagle or Aquila here), and it is distinct from Petteia in this regard.
Except for the special characteristics of the king it is played by
essentially the same rules. Here is a peculiar description of a game
that appears to be Latrunculi from the Persian writer Firdawsi (300
AD?), who presumed to describe the origin of chess in the East. This is
the description of the King of India answering the King of Persia's
challenge to learn this game. </font></b></font></b></b></p><p>
</p><ol><b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial"><i>He arranged
an army similar to that of chess; he placed the two sides in order of
battle and distributed the troops, ready for battle and for the assault
of the town, among eight houses. The field was black, the battle-field
square, and there were two powerful kings of good disposition who
should both move without ever receiving injury. Each had at his side an
army in its arrangements, collected at the head of the field, and ready
for the fray. The two kings advanced upon the field of battle, their
troops moved on all sides around them, each trying to outgo the other;
now they fought on the heights, now on the plains; when two on one side
had surprised a man by himself, he was lost to his side, and the two
armies remained face to face until it was seen who was beaten.</i></font></b></font></b></b></ol><p>
</p><p></p><center><b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial"><img src="latruncu_files/lp2.jpg" height="324" width="512"></font></b></font></b></b></center><p>
<b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial">This particular game was
supposed to have been played on an 8 x 8 board with 8 men and a king on
each side, although this description seems to exaggerate all the
proportions and actions. This passage suggests at least two types of
players, the king and the ordinary troops, which makes it distinct from
Petteia. Note that the two sides were first placed "in order of battle"
(lined up in starting position) before he "distributed the troops"
(moved into opening positions). This colorful description of what is
most definitely Latrunculi is strikingly similar to that given in a
poem known as Laus Pisonis which was written by Saleius Bassus during
the middle of the Ist century A. D.:</font></b></font></b></b></p><p>

</p><ol><b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial"><i>Cunningly the
pieces are disposed on the open board and battles are fought with
soldiery of glass, so that now White blocks Black, now Black blocks
White. But every foe yields to thee, Piso; marshalled by thee, what
piece ever gave way? What piece on the brink of death dealt not death
to his enemy? Thousand-fold are thy battle tactics: one man in fleeing
from an attack himself overpowers him, another, who has been standing
on the look-out, comes up from a distant corner; another stoutly rushes
into the mêlée and cheats his foe now creeping on his prey; another
courts blockade on either flank and under feint of being blocked,
himself blocks two men; another's objective is more ambitious, that he
may quickly break through the massed phalanx, swoop into the lines and,
razing the enemy's rampart, do havoc in the walled stronghold.
Meantime, although the fight rages fiercely, the hostile ranks are
split, yet thou thyself are victorious with serried lines unbroken or
despoiled maybe of one or two men and both thy hands rattle with the
prisoned throng.</i></font></b></font></b></b><p></p></ol>

<b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial">The phrase "Cunningly
the pieces are disposed on the open board" strongly suggests that
opening formations are important to subsequent play in the game. This
is typical of most strategy games in which the first few moves are used
to create strategic positions with which to begin more detailed (direct
contact) engagements. In Chess these are called "openings" and in
Japanese Go they are known as "Fuseki." </font></b></font></b></b><p>

<b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial">Other clues as to the
nature and play of Latrunculi come from the Vikings, who enjoyed a
similar game called Hnefatafl. This game is related to a group of games
played by the Danes, the Swedes, the Lapps, the British and the Irish.
Although the initial arrangements are different, in all other respects
this games is played almost the same as Latrunculi. Since the players
in this game all have the move of a rook, we can conclude that the same
must be true in Latrunculi. Also, the king in Hnefatafl cannot be
captured, but can be immobilized, and the sides cannot be used for
captures.</font></b></font></b></b></p><p>


<b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial">One source misinterprets
the phrase of Bassus, "pieces are disposed" (or sometimes "pieces are
distributed") to mean that the stones were deliberately placed in these
opening positions during a preliminary phase of the game. This
hypothetical first phase necessitates the invention of an unlikely rule
-- that no captures could take place during this phase. In fact, the
first quotation, which says "He arranged an army similar to that of
chess..." makes it evident that the two sides began on opposite sides
of the board before they "distributed the troops." The contention that
a separate opening phase existed in Latrunculi is an unnecessary
artifice that seems to have been inspired by a modern version of the
Egyptian game Seega, although there seems to be no evidence that the
ancient version of Seega was played in this way. If Chess were played
this way, by alternately placing pieces on the board during an opening
phase while disallowing captures, it would be seen by players as an
useless contrivance. Furthermore, any realistic position that could be
created by alternately placing pieces on the board could also be
achieved by moving pieces into place from the starting position, making
such a postulated "opening phase" as redundant as it is pointless. In
any event, the Stanway game below proves beyond doubt that there was no
opening phase without captures in Latrunculi.</font></b></font></b></b></p><p>

<b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial">Varro makes reference to Latrunculi in the following passage:
</font></b></font></b></b></p><p></p><ol><b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial"><i>"Ad
hunc quadruplicem fontem ordines deriguntur bini, uni transversi,
alteri derecti, ut in tabula solet in qua latrunculis ludunt."<br>
"To this fourfold spring two sets of lines are drawn up, the ones
crosswise and the others vertical, as is the regular arrangement on a
board on which they play with movable pieces."</i></font></b></font></b></b><p></p></ol>

<b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial">In 1996 a game in
progress, shown in the above photo, was discovered at Stanway in Essex,
England. The arrangement of the stones clearly indicates the starting
position. The board which had a length of 12 spaces, and a width of 8
has disappeared, but the hinges and metal fittings were still present
and the stones remained essentially in place where they were left.
Several moves had already been played. The extra white and black
pieces, the kings, were placed on the second line, asymmetrically
opposite like the kings in Chess. The kings must have been moved once
each, and the only symmetrical positions they could possibly have moved
from are shown in the diagram and photo below. </font></b></font></b></b><p>
</p><center><b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial"><img src="latruncu_files/latbord.gif" height="240" width="640"></font></b></font></b></b></center>

<b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial">Although in Hnefatafl
the king could only move only one space at a time, it is clear from the
Stanway game that the kings have moved several spaces in one move, like
the other pieces. The photo below illustrates the opening moves in the
Stanway game.</font></b></font></b></b><p>
</p><center><b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial"><img src="latruncu_files/stanlat.jpg" height="446" width="640"></font></b></font></b></b></center>

<p>
<b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial">A layout of the
gameboard is shown below, based on the game found at Stanway in Essex,
England. The kings are located symmetrically opposite one another, like
the kings in modern chess. Each king is placed right of center in front
of twelve latro on a 12 x 8 board. Furthermore, the king cannot be
captured, but can only be penned up. In all other respects, this game
is played by the same rules as Petteia. Two men may capture an enemy
player by enclosing him on two sides, horizontal or vertical. When the
king is immobilized, the game is over, regardless of how many stones
are left on the board.

</p><center><h2><b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial"><b>DISCUSSION OF THE PROPOSED AND ALTERNATIVE RULES FOR LATRUNCULI</b></font></b></font></b></b></h2></center>
<b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial"><b>Various alternative
rules have been suggested by others, but none of these have a sound
basis in literature or logic and they do not produce a truly playable
game. The assumed rule that lets a stone jump over other stones as in
Checkers adds nothing to the game and seems to contradict the concept
of "blocking" opponents stones. A related alternative rule that
suggests that the king (or dux) may jump over enemy stones also seems
to contradicts the fact that a king can be immobilized. The assumed
rule discussed earlier that would place stones on the board in an
opening phase can be dismissed based on the evidence from Stanway. The
use of dice in this game is similarly absurd. The use of a double row
of stones in the opening position, as in Checkers, is most improbable,
as is playing the stones on the intersections rather than inside the
squares.</b></font></b></font></b></b><p>
<b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial"><b>Another rule has been
suggested in which the stones in contact with the king form a mandra
and cannot be captured along the same line as the king. This is not a
rule but a direct consequence of the fact that if a king is present in
a line of stones a multiple stone capture by the opponent is impossible
along that line. Proposed Rule 7 above has been adopted based on the
similar game Shogi, as discussed previously, but has no major impact on
the game. Rule 11 is based on the anecdote at the end of this webpage
where a player was ahead by one point -- the score wouldn't be kept if
it didn't mean something.</b></font></b></font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial"><b>Proposed Rule 10
above represents a literal interpretation of the term "immobilization"
and is also based on the mode of play in the derivative game of
Hnefatafl. Rule 10 allows a single white stone to capture an enemy king
by blocking it against its own stones and/or the sides, <img src="latruncu_files/latbord5.gif" align="right" height="167" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="215">
as shown in the figure at right where a white move to 'A' immobilizes
the king and wins the game. This rule changes the focus of the game
from capturing enemy stones, as in Petteia, to cornering the king with
clever forcing moves, and can furthermore make for sudden victory, even
by an outnumbered force. Without Rule 10 it is difficult for either
player to make progress unless someone makes a mistake, and the game
often becomes a drawn-out standoff like Petteia. Readers are encouraged
to try the game with and without this rule to see for themselves that
it not only makes the most sense but also produces the most engaging
and delightful version of the game possible. </b></font></b></font></b></b></p><p>
<b><b><font face="Arial"><b><font face="Arial"><b>Given the above
proposed rules, there seems to be room and opportunity for strategic
openings that would give players the ability to carry on a fighting
struggle, but what the opening strategies are that work best remain to
be rediscovered. Likely, the Romans knew various strategic openings as
Chess players do today. The rook-like moves allow each stone to 'cover'
lanes on the board (or create points that it would be death to occupy),
and it is likely that players would try to initially maximize coverage
before embarking on attack strategies. The Stanway opening strongly
suggests the players were positioning their stones in an opening
formation that would give each control over different areas of the
board. Also, the descriptions of the game suggest that placing a roving
player behind enemy lines is a probable necessity since the board can
easily be blocked off by the enemy. Perhaps the best piece to send
behind enemy lines is the king, since it cannot be captured. The photos
below shows the author's Latrunculi board with pyramidal shaped kings
in the starting arrangement on a 12x8 board.
