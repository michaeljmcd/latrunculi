[misc
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060805094300
 Miscellaneous odds and ends. Tweaked move speed for the slide. Mostly cleaning up from the attempt to convert the vectors to s8vectors.
 Added 5 sec. to AI search time.
] 
[safety
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060804164841
 Controls have been added to make sure the user doesn't do anything during animation.
] 
[ai re-integrated.
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060804164544
 The AI/verification has been re-integrated into the system. This includes animation of AI moves.
] 
[slide
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060804155530
 Slide effect is now completed. AI/error checking still disabled.
] 
[fade-out
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060804104042
 Fade out is now fully implemented. The slide effect is not, and the error-checking mechanisms will not
 be re-enabled until it is.
] 
[end of day submit, 8/7/06
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060807220405
 Moved some code around in move.scm. Now, make-move is just a wrapper for move-piece followed by affect-captures. Move-piece makes a move, but does not take its ramifications (like caputures) into affect.
 The rationale for this was that we needed to be able to separate the two for the sake of special fx in the opengl engine.
 
 Work also begun on the fade effect, but was not completed.
 Some important lines of code (move validation, ai launch, etc.) were commented out for the debugging of the fade effect. These will be reinstated
 when the fade effect is completed.
 
] 
[savegame
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060730105945
 Save game functions implemented, but untested and unintegrated with the actual system.
 Commit before writing GLUT out of the program.
] 
[move validation bug fix
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060730055917
 The bug appears to be fixed with relation to the move validator.
] 
[threading fix
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060730043854
 Creating a separate thread for the glut main loop and removing the thread-join! call for the AI's thread solved the problem of things not running.
 TODO: the current threading is "too fair". The time quantuums should be skewed in the AI's favor, but are, instead, equal.
] 
[move validation
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060729092239
 The computer now performs move validation on all of the user's moves. If they are invalid, they do not take effect.
 Changes valid in both graphical engines.
] 
[misc
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060728070235
 Some work begun on AI addition. Not much, though.
] 
[mouse picking
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060728061644
 We now, officially, have mouse picking. Pieces will move and capture/be captured as expected. 
 TODO: Integrate AI into the equation.
] 
[move functions forked
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060728055651
 For the sake of storing the move functions in one locale, they were forked from the AI code into their own file. 
 This is so that OpenGL has access to the move functions, but not the AI ones (which it does not require).
] 
[mouse picking alpha
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060728054849
 We finally have progress on the mouse picking. The pixel read holds the correct coordinates and some code has been added to track the first space in the move.
 Strangely, despite the fact that the pixels read are 100% accurate, the coordinate genrated is always (0 . 0). Working on this bug.
] 
[choppy gfx fixed
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060724200749
 Some color-coding mouse function code added. The choppy graphics have also been fixed, though I do not know for sure what fixed it.
] 
[2x buffers
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060726163812
 Removed preliminary mouse picking code (in favor of working on it separately, then integrating). 
 Added double buffering support, which works and drastically smooths the work done while rotating the view. Still has problems with certain angles (starts 
 chopping things up in very strange ways; filed as bug #20).
] 
[picking, ncurses
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060720093817
 Started to implement mouse picking, though no change will yet be obvious to the user. Removed extraneous "win" parameter from some of the ncurses functions.
] 
[display lists added
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060718092021
 Added display lists for the pawns (both black and white) using OpenGL's quadrics to generate them with texturing.
] 
[board working--almost
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060718081953
 A textured board (with border) is now drawn. The problem with the sheared corners has been fixed. The broken board corners have not, however, been repaired.
] 
[getting there
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060717185351
 A couple of bugs, but we're getting there.
] 
[more list work
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060717160843
 More work has been done on the lists. However, a problem with either Chicken or its OpenGL bindings has been discovered that limits the number of commands run 
 within a display list. Options: fix the limit or apply two commands to generate a cube.
] 
[textures
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060717141144
 Textures now load properly (presuming several things about the TGA image) and work has been begun on display lists.
] 
[triangulation
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060715115230
 Begun the process of breaking down the primitives into real polygons for use with texturing.
] 
[targa
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060715113654
 targa.scm now works for loading pixel data for all true color TGA files without compression.
 Work has begun integrating it with gfx.scm to build textures.
] 
[tga work
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060715084712
 targa.scm is almost to the point of reading image data. The headers are read. Next is the color map (where applicable) followed by the actual picture data. 
 Haven't started on RLE.
] 
[add
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060715025431
 Just finished adding the SCM files to tests.
] 
[targa.pdf
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060715025344
 Targa.pdf describes the TGA format.
] 
[tests
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060715025222
 Moved all of the unit tests into their own source folder named tests.
] 
[image additions
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060715025048
 Added images to be used for the textures. Added file (targa.scm) that will load TGA files and have begun work parsing the file format. Also added to doc/ was a 
 PDF describing the TGA format.
] 
[misc. work
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060712112006
 Some more miscellaneous work towards getting the mouse clicks to be (correctly) mapped to board spaces.
] 
[Convert mouse coords to space coords
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060712094621
 With this patch, the addition of code converting mouse clicks to spacial coordinates has been added. The ability to trace this to a specific space/piece has not 
 been created as well.
] 
[Morning commit 7/16/06
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060712040901
 Nothing added except some skeletal work on the mouse function.
] 
[OpenGL begins
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060711213544
 With this patch, fundamental OpenGL support is added to Latrunculi. We now have a basic board and pieces formed entirely from OpenGL primitives that shows up 
 properly. The next step will be to add enough mouse support to play the game.
] 
[nega-work
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060710060055
 Work on the nega-max function. Fixes an error in the implementation. When compiled to native, search completed in 13 seconds!
] 
[turn fix
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060707060214
 This patch fixes bug #5, in which turns are not properly tracked (it turned out that they weren't properly displayed, either; both problems are fixed).
] 
[find-ai-move change
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060706113929
 changed the find-ai-move function so that it only makes one pass over the list of possibilities to find the one with the high score, rather than the original two 
 (one to score the moves and the other to find the max).
] 
[board representation
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060706113821
 In this patch, the move from a list-based board representation to a vector-based one is complete.
] 
[changing spaces from pairs to integers
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060706093129
 In this patch, the representation of a space was changed from being a pair (A . B) to an integer A.
 The second value (meant as an ID) was superflous. Removing it should result in simpler and more effecient code.
] 
[ncurses display fix
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060704065620
 This patch fixes bug #2, relating to the erroneous display. There were two problems: the color pairs for white and black were somehow reversed and I never 
 noticed before and that the painting was done with vector-map, in which the order is undefined. It was changed to vector-for-each.
] 
[afternoon commit 6/7/06
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060703105647
 Work is progressing on make-move. Still have not figured out cause of coordinate bug.
] 
[make-move partial fix
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060703060749
 Fixed the problem of having a piece cloned when making a move fixed. The error was in the way the board was initialized. All of the empty rows referred to the 
 same base row, meaning that, since it was referenced, making a change to one changed them all. The coordinate system, however, is still buggy. Entering
 (0, 7) -> (0, 4) moves (11, 0) -> (11, 3).
] 
[A great deal of the conversion from a list-based board representation to a vector-based one is done.
michaeljmcd@yahoo.com**20060702112721
 Currently IP is the make-move function in ai.scm.
 initialize.scm--done
 gfx.scm--done
 main.scm done.
 
 AI nearly converted.
